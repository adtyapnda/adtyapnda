👋 Hi, I'm Aditya
CEO @ Tymora — we're building AI that understands you better than your to-do list ever could (and doesn’t judge you for skipping leg day).

I lead product and backend dev, blending code, caffeine, and occasional existential dread. My background spans AI systems, marketing experiments that worked a little too well, and building full-stack things that don’t crash. Usually.

🛠 Tech Stack (a.k.a. Tools I Argue With)
Languages: Python, C++, SQL
ML/AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, MLflow
Infra: FastAPI, Docker, Git, GCP
Bonus skill: Googling error messages at world-record speed.

Tymora – An AI that schedules you, not the other way around.

Some side projects that may or may not become sentient.
