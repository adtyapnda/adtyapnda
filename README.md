👋 Hi, I'm Aditya
CEO @ Tymora — we're building AI that understands you better than your to do list ever could

I lead product and backend dev, blending code, caffeine, and occasional existential dread. My background spans AI systems, marketing experiments that worked a little too well, and building full-stack things that don’t crash. Usually.

🛠 Tech Stack (a.k.a. Tools I Argue With)
Languages: Python, C++, SQL;
ML/AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, MLflow;
Infra: FastAPI, Docker, Git, GCP
